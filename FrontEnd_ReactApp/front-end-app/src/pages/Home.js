                you've just finished an awful sprint
                i mean all the features were bugs
                amidst system updates and browser updates
                everyone got the flu
                but the team pulled through
                you're in the final stretch and you gotta build morale
                pizza parties are for babies
                we need beer
                and not just any beer
                beer crafted by the hands of people as passionate about brewing as we are about software development
            </div>
        )
