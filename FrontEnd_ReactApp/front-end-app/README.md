#Project Purpose

Imagine you and your team just finished a god-awful sprint...I mean everything that could possibly go wrong went wrong. What you thought were simple fixes crashed the whole application. At some point you were pretty sure that all of the features were bugs. But you guys pulled through. You don't throw these people a pizza party. Hard working devs deserve more than just pizza. They deserve delicious, flavorful, potentially high ABV craft beers. 

This project solves the problem of locating unique and delicious beers shared by software engineers (at least in my Per Scholas cohort).
